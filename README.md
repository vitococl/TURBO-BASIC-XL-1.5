# TURBO-BASIC-XL-1.5

This is an attempt to recreate the sources of the original TURBO BASIC XL 1.5 interpreter by Frank Ostrowsky for Atari XL/XE computers.

As the original sources of TBXL 1.5 have gone, the community is trying to recreate them using a disassembly of the executable program and the experience of some members of the atarian comunity.

All your feedback is welcome!
